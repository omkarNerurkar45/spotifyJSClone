🎧 Spotify Clone

A responsive Spotify-like music player built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 🔥 Features

- ✅ Browse multiple playlists
- ✅ Click on a playlist to load its songs automatically
- ✅ Songs display in the library section
- ✅ Play/Pause songs
- ✅ Next/Previous track controls
- ✅ Volume control (increase/decrease/mute)
- ✅ Responsive design for all devices
- ✅ Automatically fetches playlist details from `info.json`

## 📁 How It Works

- Each playlist (e.g., `marathi/`, `ganpati/`) is stored in a separate folder inside the `songs/` directory.
- Each folder contains:
  - `.mp3` files
  - `cover.jpg` (for album art)
  - `info.json` (with playlist metadata: title, description)

The app dynamically fetches and displays playlists and songs using JavaScript.
